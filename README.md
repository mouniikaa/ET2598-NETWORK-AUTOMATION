# ET2598-NETWORK-AUTOMATION



In this project we aim to implement a web service.

1) Here there is basic PHP line which is stored in index.php 
2) Webserver used was NGINX 
3) Assuming there is a load , we execute three NGINX servers initially and      require a HAproxy to load balance the servers.


The site consists of 5 hosts which are 
1)HAproxy
2)A (webserver)
3)B (webserver)
4)C (webserver)
5)Bastion
